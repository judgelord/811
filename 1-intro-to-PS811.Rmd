# \#goals
This course builds core research skills:

## No-brainers 
- Keep data tidy
- Write readable code (e.g. pipe, don't nest)
- Write efficient, easy-to-edit code (use functions, rarely copy & paste)
- Clearly presenting your data & results (tables, figures) 
- Never copy & paste into a paper

---

## Worthwhile 
- Backing up / version control (e.g. git)
- Commenting your code 
- Being organized (e.g. project folders)
- Being portable (e.g. `here`)
- Breaking projects up into component parts

---

## Potential next steps
- Getting new data (e.g. web scraping & API's)
- Text analysis
- Classification 
- Dimension reduction
- Machine learning
- Duration modeling
- Surveys (e.g. qualtrics & mturk)
- Using remote servers

---

# 2. Markdown + git

- Using [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
- [Class notes template](https://github.com/judgelord/PS811/raw/master/example_notes.pdf)
- [Problem set template](https://github.com/judgelord/PS811/raw/master/example_problem_set.pdf)
- Publishing your course webpage/portfolio on [GitHub](http://GitHub.com)


**Assignment 1:** Publish your 811 webpage: Your research interests + potential questions, data, & methods

**Assignment 2:** Problem set in R Markdown

---

# 3. Tidy data + readable code 

- Nameing things
- Manipulating data with `dplyr` (cheatsheet) & getting the most out of other `tidyverse` tools
- Pipes with `magrittr` (`%>%` and `%<>%`)
- Output (tables, `ggplot`)
- Commenting (`# R comment`, `% LaTeX comment`, `<!-- markdown / html coment -->`)

**Assignment 3:** Choose a dataset, edit variable names & values, do something cool with it.

---

# 4. Efficient code that does not break

- Project files (e.g. data, figs, functions)
- `here`
- Saving and loading data files
- Reproducible tables and figures

**Assignment 4:** Save your data and `setup.R` script to your 811 git repository, work on data summary, use `here()` for all file paths.


---

# 5. Summary analysis

- Presenting model results 
- More `ggplot` --- choosing layers (lines, intervals, colors, labels, facets, maps)

**Assignment 5:** Finish up initial data summary: clearly show what is most interesting or puzzling about your data.

---

# 6. Data viz workshop

- Bonus (optional): convert your 811 web page to a slideshow with `xaringan` (When you have to make a conference presentation, you'll be glad you did!)

---

# 7-(n-1). TBD

--- 

# n. Final data analysis presentations

---

# More resources and thanks!
